## Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

### 1. Problem Definition
In our case, the problem we will be exploring is binary classification (a sample can only be one of two things).

This is because we're going to be using a number of differnet features (pieces of information) about a person to predict whether they have heart disease or not.

### 2. Data
The original data came from the Cleveland database from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Howevever, we've downloaded it in a formatted way from Kaggle.

The original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. Attributes (also called features) are the variables what we'll use to predict our target variable.

### 3. Evaluation

If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursure this project.
